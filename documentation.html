<p>This Battleship game starts off by welcoming the user and showing a short description of how the game works. Once the user clicks the 'start game' button, grid set up begins. The grids are generated by JavaScript and the event handlers are added to the enemy grid. At this time, the user is unable to attack (click) the opponents grid until they have followed the instructions and placed 5 boats.</p>
<p>There is an HTML5 canvas element that I made to prompt the user to follow the instructions on placing the boats. its function (drawCanvas()) is called after the start game button is clicked.</p>
<p>The user gives input in text boxes for the starting coordinates of 5 ships. They also select the orientation they would like the ship to be (vertical or horizontal). An error is given when boats overlap, and the user is prompted to select new coordinates.</p>
<p>Once the boats are placed, the user is then able to click a square on the enemy's grid. An HTML5 audio element sound is played depending on if it is a 'hit' or a 'miss'.</p>
<p>Once your turn is over, the AI waits 2 seconds before selecting a square on your grid to attack. An HTML5 audio element sound is played depending on if it is a 'hit' or a 'miss'.</p>
<p>This continues until one grid has all of their original 'boat' squares marked as 'hit', as tested by the gameOver() function after each attack is made.</p>
<p>Once the game ends, the user is no longer allowed to click on the opponents grid, and is prompted to refresh the page if they would like to play again.</p>
<p>I have decided to leave the animation from an earlier assignment in as it adds to the fun aspect of the game and is non-intrusive to game-play.</p>
